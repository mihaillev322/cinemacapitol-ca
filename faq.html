<h2>Questions and answers</h2>

<details>
<summary>What is Cinema Capitol?</summary>
<p>Cinema Capitol is an independent movie theatre offering a curated selection of films, including new releases, classic screenings, and art house cinema in a community-focused setting. Unlike large multiplex chains, independent cinemas prioritize thoughtful programming that reflects diverse tastes and cultural interests. This approach allows Cinema Capitol to present films that might not receive wide commercial distribution, from international features and documentaries to beloved classics and experimental works. The theatre fosters a welcoming environment where film enthusiasts can gather to experience cinema as both entertainment and art.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to check Cinema Capitol showtimes?</summary>
<p>You can check current showtimes by visiting the Cinema Capitol website or calling the theatre directly for the latest movie schedule and screening times. Showtimes are typically updated weekly to reflect new releases, special events, and repertory programming. Weekend matinee showtimes often differ from evening schedules, with earlier start times and family-friendly options. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, especially during holidays or festival periods, contacting the theatre by phone ensures you have the correct details before planning your visit. Many independent cinemas also post schedule changes on social media or through email newsletters.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What types of films does an independent cinema like Cinema Capitol show?</summary>
<p>Independent cinemas typically screen a mix of mainstream new releases, foreign films, documentaries, classic repertory titles, and art house features that may not be available at larger multiplex chains. This programming diversity is a hallmark of the independent cinema experience, allowing audiences to discover films from around the world and across different eras. Repertory screenings might include restored prints of cinema classics, thematic series exploring specific directors or genres, and community-selected favorites. Documentary programming often highlights social issues, cultural stories, and artistic explorations that resonate with local audiences. The curated approach means each film is chosen with intention, creating a richer and more varied cinematic landscape than standard commercial offerings.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How much do movie tickets cost at independent theatres in Canada?</summary>
<p>Ticket prices at independent Canadian cinemas generally range from $8 to $14 for regular screenings, with discounted rates often available for matinees, seniors, and children. These prices reflect the value proposition of independent theatres: intimate screening rooms, carefully selected programming, and a community-oriented atmosphere. Matinee showings, typically scheduled on weekend afternoons, often feature reduced pricing to encourage family attendance and make cinema more accessible. Some theatres also offer membership programs, punch cards, or special rates for students and groups. When compared to larger chains, independent cinema ticket prices are competitive while supporting local cultural infrastructure and unique film programming that enriches the broader Canadian film landscape.</p>

<details>
<summary>Why choose an independent cinema over a multiplex?</summary>
<p>Independent cinemas offer a more intimate and community-driven movie experience, often featuring unique programming, lower ticket prices, and a curated atmosphere that larger chain theatres cannot replicate. The difference extends beyond the films themselves to encompass the entire visit: smaller auditoriums create a more personal viewing environment, staff members are often passionate about cinema and can offer recommendations, and the theatre itself becomes a gathering place for like-minded film enthusiasts. Independent cinemas also contribute to local cultural vitality by hosting special events, Q&A sessions with filmmakers, and partnerships with film festivals and educational institutions. For audiences seeking more than just blockbuster entertainment, independent theatres provide a meaningful alternative that celebrates cinema as an art form and community resource.</p>
